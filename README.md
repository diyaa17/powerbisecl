Inventory Management Analysis

During my internship at SECL, I had the opportunity to work on a key project that involved creating a Power BI report focused on Inventory Management and Analysis.
Designed and implemented a Power BI dashboard that visualized key inventory metrics, such as stock levels and demand forecasting. The report enabled real-time tracking and analysis of inventory data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
